AI Usage Journal

Week 1:

I used AI this week in multiple instances to aid me in the exercise. I asked for explanations and examples for multiple of the prompts. For example, I asked for an explanation and example of how to call number parse, how to find keywords and extracting cutters. I did not use AI to complete or debugg any of the exercises. I consulted ChatGPT but was logged out and my chats were not saved. My project team did not use AI to organize our projects or aid us in the start up process. Overall, AI helped refresh my memory and even retaught me certain python concepts. Ultimately,I found AI useful for this exercise and would continue to use it as a learning tool 


Week 2:

There are multiple times where I used AI during this week . One was during the gorup worksheet and the others were to aid in this weeks exercise/lab. Throughout the exerecise there were some terms I didnt understand. Therefore, I asked for explanation of the terms and some examples. This allowed me to gain a clearer understanding, then allowing me to apply this to my own lab. An example of this would be on question #15 where it asked you to use slicing. That term and technique were unfamiliar to me so, I asked the context and for an example. I learned that slicing means to take part of a list using indices. I did not use AI to complete or debugg any of the exercises. My project team used AI this week to organize our project and brainstorm ideas. Overall, AI helped taught and retaught me certain python concepts. Ultimately, I found AI useful for this exercise and would continue to use it as a learning tool.
