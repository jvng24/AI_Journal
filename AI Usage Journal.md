Week 1:

I used AI this week in multiple instances to aid me in the exercise. I asked for explanations and examples for multiple of the prompts. For example, I asked for an explanation and example of how to call number parse, how to find keywords and extracting cutters. I did not use AI to complete or debugg any of the exercises. I consulted ChatGPT but was logged out and my chats were not saved. My project team did not use AI to organize our projects or aid us in the start up process. Overall, AI helped refresh my memory and even retaught me certain python concepts. Ultimately,I found AI useful for this exercise and would continue to use it as a learning tool 


Week 2:

There are multiple times where I used AI during this week . One was during the gorup worksheet and the others were to aid in this weeks exercise/lab. Throughout the exerecise there were some terms I didnt understand. Therefore, I asked for explanation of the terms and some examples. This allowed me to gain a clearer understanding, then allowing me to apply this to my own lab. An example of this would be on question #15 where it asked you to use slicing. That term and technique were unfamiliar to me so, I asked the context and for an example. I learned that slicing means to take part of a list using indices. I did not use AI to complete or debugg any of the exercises. My project team used AI this week to organize our project and brainstorm ideas. Overall, AI helped taught and retaught me certain python concepts. Ultimately, I found AI useful for this exercise and would continue to use it as a learning tool. 


Week 3:

Again, I used AI this week to help be better understand course concepts. I also used them to explain them to me as well as give examples. I had a base foundation of knowledge when it came to functiosn because of INST126. So, I needed some extra guidance. I also used sources outsife of ChatGPT, specifically W3 schools (https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp). This website explains the concept, gives you actual code examples, and quizzes you on your knowledge. Regarding the week 3 exercise, I had issues doing #19. In this case, I asked how swapping entries worked as well as examples. Another exercise I had issues with #30 just because the wording was confusing. I asked CHatGPT to better word it , allowing me to write the code. I didnt use it for any group work and I did not use this to debugg. 


Week 4:

I used AI this week to help understand the topics again. I would say this week was the hardest for me so far, so I admit to using AI to teach me a lot more. I also used outside sources such as youtube and again, https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp. I find this source to be useful because it uses step by step instructions as well as visuals. They even provide you with the code to try out yourself. A few examples of how I used AI was to ask things such as "how do attributes work?" or "how to format a query?". I also asked for it to provide examples as well as outside exercises to strengthen my undestanding. I haven't started on the team project yet but I will most likely use AI as assistance as well. Overall, AI has been a good learning tool. I did not use it to debugg or to do any of my work. 


Week 5:

I used AI this week for the project as well as the lab. I used it more on the team project due to the complexity of the assignment. Me and my team used to to brainstorm functions based on the basis of our project. Based on the ones given, we created functions based on the ones that best applied to our project. I was also confused about the docstring formatting and asked for an explanation. The functions that received AI assistance was 3,5,7,8,14. The formatting structure of the code was the most confusing so it aided with that. After collaborating with AI, I learned that it can be used as a useful assistant. Although main topics are known, there will always be tiny things that I might not remember. Being able to ask something instantly makes the process more efficient and grows my understanding. 


Week 6:

This week I used AI to aid me in the lab. Outside of AI, I used this site again: https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp. This site has actually done very well in teaching and reinforcing prior python knowledge. It gives exampels, and breaks down the concepts step by step. They even have little quizzes to test your understanding. Along with the site I used some random people on youtube. The code has gotten harder so i've been needing to use more outside resources to help me. Instead of ChatGPT I used Gemini which is somewhat similar. Personally, I think that ChatGPT is more natural and intuitive to use. Regarding the information I used it for, was for class methods. For example, for question 17 it asks for me to add class methods that create reservations. I was confused about how exactly to do that so I asked for an explanation and some examples. If I was still confused I went to the above website to see if it'd help. 


Week 7: 

This week I used AI to help me with the lab that was assigned this week. I also used AI to help me with project #2 as it is definetely a more complex assignment overall. Per usual, I've been using this site to guide me through the course: https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp. Outside of the site I have also been using random videos on Youtube to solidify topics that I dont understand. After reviewing these resources, I then use ChatGPT in order to simulate examples as well as practice questions in order to test my understanding. For example, throughout the lab it asked for me to create test methods. This concept was confusing to me so I asked ChatGPT "What exactly is a test method and how does it work". It then responded by giving me its purpose, structure, how it checks behavior, how automatted running works, and how to optionally clean it up. This cleared up my confusion and gave me a foundation to do the lab. 


Week 8: 

This week I tried using AI to get through the lab about inheritance and polymorphism. Instead of figuring it all out alone, I turned to ChatGPT for breakdowns and sample code on subclassing, swapping methods, and how objects act in different contexts. That made things clearer such as why super() matters, tweaking describe() and __str__() my own way, or working out late fees per book type without stacking if or elif checks.
I checked with AI to figure out why using composition beat inheritance when tacking a Notifier onto LoanDesk. Aside from that, I continued to strengthen my Python basics using w3schools per usual. I also ran through a few YouTube clips to strengthen the ideas. When it came to trying Overall, ChatGPT really made things fit together after reviewing other materials. AI helped connect ideas with real work and also boosted my confidence in python.


Week 9: 

This week, I turned to AI for help grasping abstract classes along with their properties, classmethods, template patterns, and how virtual subclasses are registered in Python. Instead of solving tasks directly, it offered breakdowns and illustrations - this made ideas like media_type, borrowable, or download_link() within Protocols clearer. When issues came up, such as a TypeError during subclass creation, the feedback pointed out where things went wrong. It also showed how to properly set up required abstract methods. While I didn't rely on it for coding assignments or fixing bugs, it strengthened my foundation through explanation rather than solutions. I relied on W3Schools along with some YouTube guides to support my study process. In general, AI enabled me to link theoretical ideas with real coding tasks, deepened my grasp of polymorphism and abstraction, while boosting my self-assurance when using ABCs and Protocols solo.


Week 10: 

This week, I kept applying AI to better understand topics from the exercises, focusing on Python’s data models, properties, and magic methods. Instead of just reading the slides, I used AI when stuck on ideas like @property with get/set/delete logic. It also explained __post_init__ behavior in dataclasses, which cleaned up initialization steps. Concepts such as __str__ versus __repr__, along with __iter__ and __contains__, became clearer through concrete samples. For class design, AI showed how these elements work together inside objects like Book. When building collections similar to Catalog, total_ordering from functools made comparisons simpler. Each query narrowed gaps in my understanding. One time, I looked into sorting based on varied criteria while exploring how Python handles loops and membership checks. Such responses strengthened my grasp of core object behaviors alongside simple collection designs. I didn't use AI to write or fix my work but, it helped me review ideas, understand terms, also go through problems slowly. 


Week 12: 

This week, I focused on comprehensive testing and safe refactoring to ensure my projects work correctly as complete systems. I used AI to clarify unit, integration, and system testing concepts, especially for coordinating components like containers, cells, and plants in the garden system. AI also helped me understand refactoring techniques, such as extract methods and adding persistence without breaking existing code. I continued using W3Schools and YouTube for extra examples. AI was a helpful guide for planning tests and improving code quality, but I did not rely on it to write or debug my code. Overall, it strengthened my understanding of testing strategies and system architecture while boosting my confidence.


Week 13: 

This week, I used AI to help with Project 4’s challenges because it pulled together every topic we’ve covered like inheritance, polymorphism, saving data, workflows, plus complete testing. Instead of going into the work immediately, I first looked over class notes, checked W3Schools, and watched  short videos to help me understand the content and writing files along with managing JSON or CSV formats. After getting comfortable with these ideas, I used ChatGPT to outline the big-picture structure in smaller chunks. One thing I asked was how loading and saving would fit within current classes. I also relied on AI to understand how unit, integration, and system tests differ within my specific project setup. For example, it provided cases where object-level checks stand alone compared to broader tests mimicking actual user actions.
