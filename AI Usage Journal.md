AI Usage Journal

Week 1

I used AI this week in multiple instances to aid me in the exercise. I asked for explanations and examples for multiple of the prompts. For example, I asked for an explanation and example of how to call number parse, how to find keywords and extracting cutters. I did not use AI to complete or debugg any of the exercises. I consulted ChatGPT but was logged out and my chats were not saved. My project team did not use AI to organize our projects or aid us in the start up process. Overall, AI helped refresh my memory and even retaught me certain python concepts. Ultimately,I found AI useful for this exercise and would continue to use it as a learning tool
