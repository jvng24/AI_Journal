Week 1:

I used AI this week in multiple instances to aid me in the exercise. I asked for explanations and examples for multiple of the prompts. For example, I asked for an explanation and example of how to call number parse, how to find keywords and extracting cutters. I did not use AI to complete or debugg any of the exercises. I consulted ChatGPT but was logged out and my chats were not saved. My project team did not use AI to organize our projects or aid us in the start up process. Overall, AI helped refresh my memory and even retaught me certain python concepts. Ultimately,I found AI useful for this exercise and would continue to use it as a learning tool 


Week 2:

There are multiple times where I used AI during this week . One was during the gorup worksheet and the others were to aid in this weeks exercise/lab. Throughout the exerecise there were some terms I didnt understand. Therefore, I asked for explanation of the terms and some examples. This allowed me to gain a clearer understanding, then allowing me to apply this to my own lab. An example of this would be on question #15 where it asked you to use slicing. That term and technique were unfamiliar to me so, I asked the context and for an example. I learned that slicing means to take part of a list using indices. I did not use AI to complete or debugg any of the exercises. My project team used AI this week to organize our project and brainstorm ideas. Overall, AI helped taught and retaught me certain python concepts. Ultimately, I found AI useful for this exercise and would continue to use it as a learning tool. 


Week 3:

Again, I used AI this week to help be better understand course concepts. I also used them to explain them to me as well as give examples. I had a base foundation of knowledge when it came to functiosn because of INST126. So, I needed some extra guidance. I also used sources outsife of ChatGPT, specifically W3 schools (https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp). This website explains the concept, gives you actual code examples, and quizzes you on your knowledge. Regarding the week 3 exercise, I had issues doing #19. In this case, I asked how swapping entries worked as well as examples. Another exercise I had issues with #30 just because the wording was confusing. I asked CHatGPT to better word it , allowing me to write the code. I didnt use it for any group work and I did not use this to debugg. 


Week 4:

I used AI this week to help understand the topics again. I would say this week was the hardest for me so far, so I admit to using AI to teach me a lot more. I also used outside sources such as youtube and again, https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp. I find this source to be useful because it uses step by step instructions as well as visuals. They even provide you with the code to try out yourself. A few examples of how I used AI was to ask things such as "how do attributes work?" or "how to format a query?". I also asked for it to provide examples as well as outside exercises to strengthen my undestanding. I haven't started on the team project yet but I will most likely use AI as assistance as well. Overall, AI has been a good learning tool. I did not use it to debugg or to do any of my work. 


Week 5:

I used AI this week for the project as well as the lab. I used it more on the team project due to the complexity of the assignment. Me and my team used to to brainstorm functions based on the basis of our project. Based on the ones given, we created functions based on the ones that best applied to our project. I was also confused about the docstring formatting and asked for an explanation. The functions that received AI assistance was 3,5,7,8,14. The formatting structure of the code was the most confusing so it aided with that. After collaborating with AI, I learned that it can be used as a useful assistant. Although main topics are known, there will always be tiny things that I might not remember. Being able to ask something instantly makes the process more efficient and grows my understanding.
